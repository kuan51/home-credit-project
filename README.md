# Home Credit Default Risk - MSBA Capstone Project

## Course Information

This repository contains the project work for **IS 6850-004: Predictive Analytics Project** (Spring 2026), part of the University of Utah's MSBA Capstone program.

### About the MSBA Capstone

The MSBA Capstone is designed to bridge classroom learning with real-world analytics practice. It consists of two sequential courses:

- **Capstone 1 (IS 6812)**: A practice project that prepares students with essential tools and methodologies
- **Capstone 2 (IS 6813)**: A staged business analytics case competition sponsored by a local company

This semester, IS 6850 serves as part of the new capstone sequence (1.5 credits) and covers the same material as the traditional Capstone 1 course.

### Course Overview

This course features a **predictive analytics project** hosted on Kaggle focused on the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) competition. Over the entire semester, students work through all phases of a data science project—from problem framing to final presentation—with emphasis on business value rather than purely on model performance.
